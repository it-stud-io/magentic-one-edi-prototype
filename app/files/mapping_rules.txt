Direct Assignment:
- usually used when source and target field have same semantic and syntax
- visualize in the way <output field name> <- <input field name>
- e.g. <customer number> <- <client no.>

Fixed Value:
- usually used when fields are set with a fixed value
- vidualize in the way <output field name> <- "VALUE"
- e.g. <warehouse id> <- "WH123"

Lookup:
- usually used when values are expressed as codes and need to be translated
- uses a lookup table with schema <lookup field>, <value from>, <value to>
- e.g. "country code", DE, Germany
- visualize in the way <output field name> <- xref(<input field name>, <lookup field>)
- e.g. <country> <- xref(<country-iso3>, <country code>)

Custom:
- usually used when source and target field have a common semantic, but different syntax
- visualize using common known expression functions, such as <output field name> <- EXP(<input field name>)
- e.g. <delivery date> <- DATE(<del date>, dd-mm-yyyy)
